## Installation üöÄ

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-password-manager.git
   cd simple-password-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The development server should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`, and you can use the app in your browser.

## Usage üß≠

1. **Add New Password**:
   - Use the form to input a website, username, and password.
   - The password will be securely stored in the browser's localStorage.

2. **View Passwords**:
   - A list of saved passwords will be displayed.
   - You can view, edit, or delete passwords.

## Security Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This password manager stores data in **localStorage**, which does not include encryption by default. It is suitable for basic password management but may not be ideal for highly sensitive data.
- Consider integrating encryption techniques to further secure stored passwords if needed.
